# Threesmodel

This is an attempt at emulating the game model of the excellent game "Threes".
It is implemented in Ruby and specified with Gehrkin and rspec examples.
The gem is not indended to be a game in it self, but with relative ease one
could use it as the game engine for a command line or a web version of the game.
## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'threesmodel'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install threesmodel

## Usage

Hmm... more information will be provided in time.
